This program **is not made by me**, the original source code made by rootabx can be found [here](https://github.com/Gork3m/MrsMajor-3.0.git), all the credits go to its respective creator. I rewritten the code in Visual Basic .NET just for fun so I highly recommend you to don't ignore the above warnings.

**Note**: some fragments of the source code are modified for better understanding the code / optimization / bug fixes/ compatibility reasons / etc but the result do exactly the same thing than in the original code.
