# Do not use this code for malicious purposes, or you'll have a bad time at jail. (not kidding).

# This source is for antivirus developers, or people into malware analysing. 

# Do not try to build your own mrsmajor - that won't work though. The code is already modified in a way so it will not work when its built into an exe.

I've rewritten the code in VB.NET just for educational purposes and **the above warnings are not a joke!**

# rootabx has written the original source code of the malware which is available [here](https://github.com/Gork3m/MrsMajor-3.0/).
